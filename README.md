Crocodile -- NumPy Simplified Imaging for Aperture Synthesis Radio Telescopes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a new, still experimental, project to create a reference code
in NumPy for somewhat simplified aperture synthesis imaging.

Warning: The current code is an experimental proof-of-concept. More
here soon. 


Simulate_uvw iPython Notebook
-----------------------------

This is an interactive notebook demonstrating the steps in simulate.py and t1.py. 
To run it you must have a copy of VLA_A_hor_xyz.txt from the /test directory 
available in your working directory.

> ipython notebook Simulate_uvw.ipynb

This will open the interactive notebook in your default web browser.
