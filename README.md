Crocodile -- NumPy Simplified Imaging for Aperture Synthesis Radio Telescopes
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a new, still experimental, project to create a reference code
in NumPy for somewhat simplified aperture synthesis imaging.

Warning: The current code is an experimental proof-of-concept. More
here soon.
